## Machine Learning Model for Binary Classification

This Python program trains and evaluates a machine learning model to perform binary classification on a dataset.

## Dependencies

The following python libraries are needed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle

## Usage

~ Install the dependencies.

~ Download the training1.csv, training2.csv, and test.csv datasets and save them in the same directory as this program.

~ Run the code in a Python environment. The main function trains a logistic regression classifier and evaluates its performance on the test dataset.

~ The code also performs feature selection, grid    search with cross-validation for two other classifiers (SVM and Random Forest), and saves the results to a file.

~ The test predictions are saved to a file named test_predictions.csv.
